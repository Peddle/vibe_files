I need you to find potential code debt focused the following file: $ARGUMENTS

In the process of investigating potential code debt in this file you should explore relevant related parts of the code base.
Make heavy use of code agents to understand how this file fits into the larger project better. Instruct the subagents to ultrathink about their task. You should also ultrathink when consolidating subagent results.

Watch out especially for the following types of code debt:
1. legacy code paths
2. code duplication / missing abstractions
3. dead code paths

You should act like a linter and return a list of issues including line numbers
