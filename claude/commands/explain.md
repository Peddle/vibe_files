I need you to deeply explain the following
<explanation_request>
$ARGUMENTS
</explanation_request>

In doing this use the following steps:
Step 1: Explore the code base and to understand how this request relates to the existing code base
    - make heavy use of subagents (Agent tool) here and tell them to ultrathink as hard as possible on their subtask.
    - create TODOs to track what you understand and what you still need to learn

Step 2: ultrathink as hard as you can on the ideal way to explain this concept to the user as clearly and consicely as possible.
